# .dotfiles

Well, it's about time I got a grip on my personal dotfiles folder, which has only filled with bloat and tidbits of script that I've accumulated over the years. This is the WIP repo for my refreshed dots. 

## TODO
- one-and-done setup script 
- aliases and .inputrc 
- shell rc (zsh)
- oh-my-zsh plugins + install script 
- common dependencies install script 
- tmux configs 
- vim config
